description: Repo-specific PR-driving policy Claude Code consults before acting on CI, review, or merge events for a PR it opened or drives on the author's behalf — auto-merge mechanics, bot-review handling, and the re-review-request idiom this repo's bot reviewer needs. Takes precedence over generic PR-driving judgment; consulted automatically, not meant for direct/manual invocation. See babysit/SKILL.md for the separate polling-cadence policy — this file does not restate it.

# steward

Mechanics for driving a PR to green in this repo, distilled from this org's own multi-session
relay history — long-running stories that span many sessions, each one picking up from a
self-contained handoff the previous session wrote (see `handoff-template.md` in this
directory). Nothing here weakens a "never" rule the parent Claude Code instructions state
(skip a real CI failure, disable or quarantine a test, rewrite someone else's branch history,
widen a PR beyond what a finding needs) — it only nails down mechanics sessions on this relay
have gotten wrong before, so the next one doesn't have to relearn them.

## Re-request review after every push

`chatgpt-codex-connector` (this repo's bot reviewer) only reviews a PR on open,
ready-for-review, or an explicit mention by default — **not on every subsequent push,
including a rebase**. A rebase changes the head SHA even when the diff content doesn't, and
`babysit/SKILL.md`'s review-coverage check matches that exact SHA — skip the request on a
rebase and the PR can never satisfy that check again, however many check-ins pass. After
every push that changes the head SHA, leave a PR comment explicitly requesting review
(`@codex review`) before waiting on anything else.

## Treat every bot finding as a bug report until traced and disproven

Across this org's relay history the false-positive rate on Codex findings has been at or near
zero, repeatedly, across unrelated stories and unrelated packages. Don't rubber-stamp a finding
and don't wave one off as noise without tracing it against the actual code/DOM/data semantics
involved. When a finding is real: fix it, reply on the _specific_ review comment/thread (not a
general PR comment) naming the fix and its commit SHA, then resolve that thread. When a finding
is real but genuinely out of scope for this PR: reply explaining why and where the real fix is
routed (a follow-up issue, a named future story), and leave the thread **open** — don't resolve
away feedback that's still true just because fixing it isn't this PR's job.

## Cap the review-fix cycle — a diff has no upper bound on how many findings it can surface

A fix's own diff is new surface area for the next review, and there is no a priori bound on
how many rounds that can take — this canon's own landing PR hit real, escalating findings for
seven straight rounds, each fix surfacing ground the previous rounds hadn't touched. "Treat
every finding as real" (above) is still correct, but combined with an unconditional
re-request-after-every-push idiom it has no natural stopping point, and every round costs real
tokens. **After 5 review rounds since the PR was opened**, stop auto-requesting the next
review and check in with the user instead: summarize the pattern (how many rounds, how many
findings were real) and ask whether to keep going, merge as-is once CI/mergeable-state allow
it, or pause for manual review. This gates the _automatic_ continuation only — it never
excuses dropping a still-open real finding just to stay under the cap, and it doesn't apply
retroactively to rounds already spent; it only stops the _next_ auto-triggered one.

## Verify "CI is green" against live state, not the webhook event that announced it

A `check_suite.completed` webhook event can name a **stale** `head_sha` — this has happened
repeatedly, sometimes minutes after the real fix commit was already pushed. Before treating any
such event as a signal to merge: re-fetch the PR directly (`pull_request_read`/`get_check_runs`)
and compare against the PR's actual current head. Don't wait for a future webhook to confirm
it — if the current head's own completion event already arrived before this stale one showed
up, there may be no "next" event ever again, and waiting for one stalls a PR that's actually
already green. The live check you just ran is the ground truth; act on what it shows. Use
`get_check_runs`, not the legacy commit-status API — this repo's CI runs as GitHub Actions
checks, and the legacy API can report `total_count: 0` while checks are actively running.

## Auto-merge, when the user has standing-authorized it for this repo

Standing authorization is scoped to the exact repo(s) it was granted for and must be restated
in every handoff, not assumed to persist silently — a grant for this repo does not imply
`paulgsc/server`, or vice versa. When it applies here: confirm CI is green on the _current_
head (per the freshness check above), confirm `mergeable_state: "clean"`, confirm bot-review
coverage on the current head is actually confirmed if this repo's reviewer doesn't auto-review
pushes (`babysit/SKILL.md`'s own criterion and graceful timeout apply here too — "no unresolved
thread" is not the same as "reviewed," since a review requested but not yet answered creates no
thread at all), confirm no unresolved review thread represents an unaddressed _fixable_ finding
(a disclosed-and-replied-to deferred gap is fine to leave open), and confirm Claude Approvals is
passing or not required for this
repo — then merge (squash, matching this repo's existing history) without pausing to ask again.
After merging: verify the linked issue actually closed, not just that the PR shows merged, then
unsubscribe from PR activity and cancel any standing check-in trigger for it.

The tool-permission classifier idiom (a scheduling/cleanup call denied independent of
GitHub-side state — retry once or twice, try a closely related tool once) and the git hygiene
discipline (`diff --stat` before committing, fresh `fetch` before trusting a local ref, restart
a branch whose predecessor PR already merged) apply here too — see the "Cold-start footguns"
section of `CLAUDE.md`, which isn't PR-lifecycle-specific so it lives there instead of being
duplicated in this file.

## Cross-repo PRs: name every one, every time

When a story spans this repo and `paulgsc/server`, never write "landed the PR" — name both,
`owner/repo#number` each. A standing auto-merge (or any other standing) authorization for this
repo does not extend to the sibling repo by implication; ask before assuming it does.
